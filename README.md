<h1>pyReader for RBC Bank Statements</h1>

by Edric Antoine

This is a simple, GUI-based application designed for viewing and interacting with
.csv files from the Royal Bank of Canada. Once a .csv file is loaded in to the application, the user will be
able to view their net gain or loss over the time period which the file covers, as well as search for and filter out transactions
from specific places, including between-account transfers.

This project was mostly made for my personal use, as I would like a way to track
how much I am making or losing in a given month, and use this information to 
make better spending decisions.

Who knows, maybe it can do the same for you!

To run this program, use the gui executable in the dist folder.

**Note: This may work with .csv files from other banking institutions, but the only one I know for sure it works with is RBC.**
